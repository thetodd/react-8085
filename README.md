# 8085 Microprocessor Simulation

This project simulates the 8085 microprocessor entirely in your browser.

## About the project
The [original project](https://github.com/thetodd/8085-Simulator) is obsolete, but the processor still enjoys some popularity especially at universities. The way the original project was created is not state of the art anymore. Also the user expirience is not the best. SO the idea was born to recreate the functionallity with a better application architecture and a modern ui.
